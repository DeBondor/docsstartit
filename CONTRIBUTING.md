## Contributing Guidelines

We encourage you to follow these guidelines when contributing to the documentation:

- Ensure that your contributions are clear, concise, and well-organized.
- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation to maintain consistency and readability.
- Mentioning other bots or services is forbidden unless it is necessary to explain a feature or functionality.
- If you are making significant changes or adding new sections, consider discussing your ideas with us beforehand
  through the issue tracker.
- Respect the existing documentation structure and formatting styles to maintain consistency across the repository.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into pages within the language directory. If you would like to contribute by adding a new
page or translating the documentation into another language, please follow the guidelines below:

- To add a new page:
    1. Search for directory corresponding to the language you're contributing to (e.g. "en" for English).
    2. Create a new .md file in this directory. The file name should be short, in lowercase and contain only letters,
       numbers, and dashes (-). Keep the file name in English. The name of the file will be in the official
       link (https://startit.bot/docs/<NAME>).
    3. Edit the "__sitebar.md" file and add link to your new page in the navigation menu.

We highly encourage contributions for translating the documentation into other languages.

- To add new language:
    1. Create a new directory with the language code (e.g. "fr" for French).
    2. Copy the contents of the "en" directory into the new directory.
    3. Translate the contents of the files into the new language. Keep the file names the same (in English).

By translating the documentation, you can help make it accessible to a wider audience and contribute to the inclusivity
of our bot.

Thank you for your contributions in expanding and translating our documentation!
