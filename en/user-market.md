# User-market â€“ a place for trading items

The user-market feature in the StartIT bot allows users to buy and sell items among themselves, creating a thriving
economy and fostering a sense of community interaction. It provides an opportunity for players to engage in trade,
discover unique items, and build their wealth.

## /market sell Command

The `/market sell <quantity> <name> <price>` command enables you to sell your items on the market, making them available
for other users to purchase. By specifying the item, quantity, and price, you can list your items for sale. This command
facilitates player-to-player transactions and promotes a dynamic marketplace within your server.

## /market list Command

The `/market list` command displays the items that users have put up for sale on the market. It provides an opportunity
for players to trade items directly with each other. By using this command, you can explore the market and discover
unique items that are available for purchase.

## /market buy Command

The `/market buy <serial>` command allows you to purchase an item listed on the market. When you find an item that
interests you, you can use this command to buy it from the seller. The serial is a sequence number of the item you want
to buy. It is displayed in the `/market list` command. Upon successful purchase, the item will be added to your
inventory, allowing you to use or trade it as desired.

## Admin: User-market and crafting as perfect combination for your server

The user-market and crafting systems are closely related, creating an interconnected economy within StartIT bot.
While the user-market allows users to trade existing items, the crafting system enables the creation of new and advanced
items by combining multiple ingredients.

By integrating the user-market and crafting, you can encourage users to participate in both aspects of the economy. For
example, you can design recipes that require specific items obtained from the user-market to craft unique and valuable
items. This encourages players to engage in trade, seek out rare ingredients, and experiment with crafting.

Additionally, you can create a dynamic economy where users specialize in either item production through crafting or item
trading through the user-market. This diversification of roles and activities enriches the overall gameplay experience
and provides opportunities for users to generate income and collaborate with others.

Remember to configure the item properties, such as availability in the shop and limitations on the number of items in
stock, to maintain balance and ensure a fair trading environment.

The combination of the user-market and crafting systems opens up new possibilities for users to explore, interact, and
shape the economy within your Discord community. Users are unlikely to leave your server if they have a real job on it
producing items that others need.
