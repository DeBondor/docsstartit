## How Users Interact with the Counting Channel

1. Users can access the Counting Channel and participate in the counting activity.

2. To start the counting sequence, a user posts the number "1" as the initial message.

3. Following the initial "1", users continue the sequence by posting the next number in line, e.g., "2", "3", "4", and
   so on.

4. The bot actively validates each message to ensure it contains the correct sequential number and follows the rules set
   by the chosen moderation option.

5. If a message breaks the sequence or violates the chosen moderation settings, the bot will delete the message.

6. Users strive to maintain the counting sequence, and the counting activity continues as long as the community enjoys
   it.

You will be presented with various options to customize the channel:

- **Channel Name**: Choose an existing Discord channel or create a new one dedicated to counting. This is where all
  the counting will take place.
  
- **Type of Moderation**:
  
    - **Option 1 - No consecutive messages**: Enabling this mode prevents a user from sending two consecutive
      messages in the Counting Channel. For instance, if User A sends "1", they will not be able to send "2"
      immediately after. This mode ensures that multiple users participate in the counting process.
  
    - **Option 2 - Without restrictions**: This mode allows users to send messages with numbers in sequential order
      without the restriction of consecutive messages by the same user. Users must ensure that they correctly
      continue the numerical sequence.

Save the configuration, and the Counting Channel is ready for your community to enjoy.
