The Auto Role plugin is designed with utmost simplicity in mind, providing an effortless way to automatically assign 
roles to users based on specific events or conditions within your Discord server. This guide aims to walk you through 
the configuration process step-by-step, enabling you to leverage the full potential of this feature to enhance your 
server's user management and community engagement.

assignments for each group.

In "Role for new humans" section you can define roles specifically for new human members joining the server. If you have

For bots that join your server, you have the option to designate specific roles that should be automatically assigned.
This capability ensures that bot accounts are readily identified and categorized within your community.

offer unique role rewards to users who boost your Discord server.
