# Stock-market â€“ place for investing money

The Stock Market is a virtual marketplace where users can trade stocks of various companies using the bot's virtual
currency. It simulates the real-world stock market and allows users to experience the thrill of investing and trading
stocks without any real financial risk.

Here is a list of commands that you can use within the Stock Market:

- `/stockmarket backpack [user]`: Displays the stocks you currently own in your backpack.
- `/stockmarket info <name>`: Provides detailed information about a specific stock.
- `/stockmarket sell <quantity> <name>`: Allows you to sell a specific quantity of a stock.
- `/stockmarket sell-all`: Sells all the stocks you currently own.
- `/stockmarket buy <quantity> <name>`: Enables you to buy a specific quantity of a stock.
- `/stockmarket list`: Lists all available stocks for trading.

## Admin: Configuring the Stock Market

To start playing around with stock market on your server go to the dashboard and set conversion rate between your
virtual currency and dollars.

Conversion rate `US$1 - 4` means that 1 real dollar is worth 4 virtual currency units. For example if you want to buy a
stock of Apple Inc. witch costs 150 real dollars you need to spent **600 virtual currency**.
