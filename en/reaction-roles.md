Choose how Selfroles will work based on your preferences and server requirements:

- **Verify**: Reacting adds roles, unreacting does nothing.
- **Reverse**: Reacting removes roles, unreacting adds roles.

Add reactions to the message to represent different roles that members can choose from.

Next, in "Manage reactions" section, assign reactions to specific roles so that members receive the appropriate roles
upon reacting to the message.
