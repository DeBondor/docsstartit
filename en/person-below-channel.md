# Person Below Channel

## Introduction

The Person Below Channel is an exciting and interactive feature of our Discord bot that encourages users to engage in a
fun question-and-answer chain. It fosters a sense of community interaction and keeps the conversation lively by allowing
users to ask and answer questions in sequence. As an administrator, you have control over the channel, and the bot will
assist in managing the questions and responses.

## How the Person Below Channel Works

The Person Below Channel operates as a playful question-and-answer chain within your Discord server. As an
administrator, you can initiate the chain by posting a question in the designated channel. The bot will then add "Yes"
and "No" buttons below your question for easy answering.

Once a user clicks on either the "Yes" or "No" button to respond to your question, they become the "person below". The
user is then required to ask a new question for the next person in the channel to answer.

The process continues as each user answers the previous question and poses a new one for the person below them. This
creates a dynamic and engaging conversation that allows community members to learn more about each other, fostering
connections and interactions.

If a user is unsure about what question to ask next, the bot can provide random example questions to inspire creativity
and keep the chain going.

## Setting Up the Person Below Channel

To set up the Person Below Channel, follow these steps:

1. Create a new channel in your Discord server.

2. Deny regular users the "Write Messages" permission for this channel. This step ensures that only the bot and
   administrators can post questions.

3. Access the "Moderated Channels Plugin" in your bot settings.

4. Look for the "Person Below" category and select it.

5. Choose the newly created channel from the list to designate it as the Person Below Channel.

6. Save the changes to apply the configuration.
