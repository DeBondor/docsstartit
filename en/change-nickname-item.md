# Change server nickname via item

The "Change User Nickname" item is a special tool that allows users to modify their nickname within the server. It
provides a fun and interactive way for users to personalize their identity and add a touch of creativity to their
presence. With this item, users can easily update their nickname without the need for manual intervention from server
administrators.

## Using the item

You can acquire this item from the server's shop and use it to change your nickname. Upon using the item, a dialog
prompt will appear, asking you to input your desired new nickname. After typing the new nickname, the bot will
automatically update it and reflect the change in the server.

It's important to note that the "Change User Nickname" item is designed for one-time use and will be destroyed after it
has been utilized unless you configure it otherwise.

## Admin: Enabling the Item

To enable the "Change User Nickname" item, follow these steps in the server dashboard:

1. Locate the item configuration section.
2. Enable the "Display Item in Shop" option to make the item available for purchase in the server's shop.

## Admin: Customizing Self-Breaking Behavior

By default, the "Change User Nickname" item is configured to be self-breaking, meaning it will be consumed and removed
from the user's inventory after usage. However, if you prefer to modify this behavior, you can make use of the
"Cooldown" option in the item configuration.

1. Enable the "Cooldown" switch in the item configuration.
2. Specify the desired cooldown duration in the provided input field. This duration determines how often users can
   change their nickname using this item.

Adjusting the cooldown duration allows you to control the frequency at which users can utilize the "Change User
Nickname" item.

With the "Change User Nickname" item, your server members can add a personal touch to their presence, express their
individuality, and have fun interacting with others in a unique way.
