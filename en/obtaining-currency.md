## /work – Main source of income. Gives a random amount of money.

The `/work` command is the main source of income in the bot's economy system. When you execute this command, you will
receive a random amount of virtual money as a reward. If you are server admin, you can encourage your members to use
this command regularly to earn funds and actively participate in the server's economy.

## /slut – Casual work. There is a chance of failure that results in loss of money.

The `/slut` command provides users with an opportunity for casual work. Users can execute this command to earn money,
but keep in mind that there is a chance of failure, which may result in the loss of virtual money.

## /crime – Illegal work. Big payout, but also big chance of losing money.

The `/crime` command provides an opportunity for you to engage in illegal work, which offers a higher payout but also
carries a greater risk of losing money. You can try own luck by executing this command, and the outcome will determine
whether you've gained or lost virtual money. As server admin encourage users to approach this command with caution,
as the results here are not guaranteed.

## /collect-income – Passive income from owning a specific role/item.

The `/collect-income` command enables you to collect money from roles and items you currently own. Some items or roles
may generate passive income, and executing this command will add the accumulated income to the wallet. It's important
for users to regularly collect their income to maximize earnings.
