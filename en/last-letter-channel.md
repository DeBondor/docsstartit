## How to Use the Last Letter Channel

1. **Join the Last Letter Channel**: To participate in the Last Letter game, users must first join the designated Last
   Letter Channel in your Discord server.

2. **Start with a Word**: The game begins with any user posting a word in the channel. This word will serve as the
   starting point for the ongoing chain.

3. **Respond with a Word**: After the first word has been posted, other users take turns responding with words that
   begin with the last letter of the previous word.

4. **Keep the Chain Going**: The objective is to maintain the word chain without repetition or breaking the sequence.
   Each word posted should start with the letter that the previous word ends with.
